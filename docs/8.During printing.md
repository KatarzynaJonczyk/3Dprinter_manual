<h1> During printing </h1>

![During printing](/during_printing.png)

The printing process consists of three steps:
- warmup
- printing
- cooldown

The current process is highlighted. 

There are two actions available during printing:
- Press the **temperature** button if you want to change slightly the temperature inside the print chamber. This is useful when you notice some abnormalities in the sintering on the print preview.
- **Press CAMERA VIEW FOR 10s** if you want to display the print chamber preview.

>**ATTENTION!**
>
>- Do not lower the temperature too quickly. Maximum 0.5 [Â°C] per one layer.
>- In case of smoke, a disturbing smell, press the safety button.
