There are two actions available during printing:
- Press the **temperature** button if you want to change slightly the temperature inside the print chamber. This is useful when you notice some abnormalities in the sintering on the print preview.
- Press **CAMERA VIEW FOR 10s** if you want to display the print chamber preview.

**IMPORTANT!** Do not lower the temperature too quickly. Maximum 0.5 [Â°C] per one layer.
